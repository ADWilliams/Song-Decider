# Aido (Song-Decider)

LHL final project. 

We developed an app that helps users to discover new songs or artists on the go. The app generates random song from RDIO API
and user can like or dislike the song by swiping left or right. 

We know there are APIs out there that does the Tinder swipe, and hamburger button, but we decided to build all the 
functions from scratch.

# Using the App

If user have premium account from RDIO the app will:
  1. Every song will play will be full tracks.
  2. Give user unlimited swipe left or right.
  3. Play full track in playlist when user selects a track.

If user don't have premium account from RDIO the app will:
  1. Play 30 seconds of a track.
  2. Have only 6 swipe left or right.
  3. Not play the track in playlist.

Step 1. When you open the app for the first time it will ask you to sign in.
        (You can sign in with Rdio account or facebook account)

Step 2. After sign up, the app will start generating random songs.

Step 3. To change genre, click the hamburger button on the top left.

Step 4. Swipe left for No, and swipe Right for Yes and the app will save all the tracks user likes.

Step 5. Select the Playlist tab bar button at the bottom of the screen to see the list user likes.

Step 6. Select the track and it will play 
        (only for premium account user)

Step 7. If user really like the song, user can select the purchase button and the app will open up iTunes.

Step 8. In playlist, swipe left to delete a track from playlist.

Step 9. Select TRAX tab bar button to jump back to listening to songs and repeat.
